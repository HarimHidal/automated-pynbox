# automated-pynbox
This is a script of my own that reads a Google spreadsheet, sends confirmation emails based on the responses stored in the spreadsheet, and responds to the emails from the inbox automatically. The project was intended for a specific college contest and the functionallity of the script may not accomodate all tasks. 

Note:
- You may need to install some of the python modules in your machine to run the scripts, to do so, you can use: pip install [ name of the module ]
